# Symptom-Tracker

Our program has a visual representation of hazardous areas to avoid because of increased illness in said areas. It does this by a poll system where a user can input their symptoms which assigns a possible illness. If there is a high likelihood of this assumption made by our program to be correct, it will then assign a value to the location of the user. There is then a gradient shade over the locations, green means - no outbreak recorded, yellow means - possible outbreak recorded, red means - very probable outbreak recorded.


## Inspiration
We've noticed that there is a lack of tools to determine outbreaks of illnesses on our campus, and around the city and world in general. We aim to change that and allow for more notice on where these outbreaks are taking place, to avoid the spread of illness.

## How I built it
The website was programmed with Django, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. We started with the most basic website design so we could build off of it as we went on. We thought out logic on whiteboards and combined our ideas and implemented them in. Everyone in the group had a different job (frontend, backend, logic) which were all important components of the project. 

## Challenges I ran into
Our original map plan did not work because an HTML feature did not work properly. The next problem we ran into was the logic for our program was flawed. We re-thought the entire way in which we gathered user data. Another problem was if we wanted to use user authentication. We had to set up GitHub and download certain language extensions.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We are proud to have a running and working website. We are also very proud of our collaboration efforts building off of each-others ideas and fixing flawed ones. We all work very well together and learned a lot of communication skills when collaborating on a project.

## What I learned
We learned different parts of each-others specialties and communication skills. We were all specialized in different aspects, such as back-end, front-end, logic, etc. We taught and built off of each-others skills.

## What's next for Outbreak Symptom Tracker
As of right now, there are some flaws, such as it being very narrow with data and symptoms, which can easily be expended given more time. For the sake a of demo, we have shrunk the data sizes such as location (which was originally made for the entire city/ maybe even world.). Possibilities of turning the website into an app as well, for easier access and more friendly UI.
