# Symptom-Tracker

Our program has a visual representation of hazardous areas to avoid because of increased illness in said areas. It does this by a poll system where a user can input their symptoms which assigns a possible illness. If there is a high likelihood of this assumption made by our program to be correct, it will then assign a value to the location of the user. There is then a gradient shade over the locations, green means - no outbreak recorded, yellow means - possible outbreak recorded, red means - very probable outbreak recorded.
